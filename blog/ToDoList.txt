Intro:

- About me
- Basics of a neural network
- Spell check


Getting data:

- Add checkLabels() sanity test
- Add more info about centering pixels around zero (pics?)
- Spell check


First network:

 - Explain why using batch training
 - Add graph for softmax
 - Put imports in explanation code properly


In general:

 - Move theory pieces out of blog posts?
   - Blog would assume people knew about neural networks, or
   - Blog would link to various other pages with more theoretical info
