Intro:

- About me
- Basics of a neural network
- Spell check


Getting data:

- Add checkLabels() sanity test
- Add more info about centering pixels around zero (pics?)
- Spell check


First network:

 - Explain why using batch training






Possibly use this later...

- **The hidden layer.** This is a layer of nodes which we don't interact with. Every node in the hidden layer is connected to every node in the input layer, and every one of these connections has a weight associated to it. Each node in the hidden layer also has a bias applied to it, and it is by adjusting these weights and biases that the network 'learns'.
