#Building our first neural network

###Overview

In this post, we'll be creating our first and most basic neural network, using TensorFlow. This is Google's contribution to the field of open-sourced neural network libraries. It uses a C++ backend, which allows for faster computations, although it can make it trickier to use to begin with, and more difficult to implement and tweak your own training algorithms later on. However, for our purposes it will do very well.
