 WHAT?

In this post, we'll be looking at setting up a simple neural network using TensorFlow, Google's recently released software for creating neural networks.

 HOW?

We start off by loading in the data from the Pickle file we created in the last post, which has all of the datasets and matching labels that our network will need. Whilst we're at it, we're also going to run a basic sanity check, making sure that the size of the datasets and labels are what we expect them to be:

	julia_1_blog.py - importPickleFile, checkSizes
